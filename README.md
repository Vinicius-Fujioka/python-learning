# Python Learning Journey 📚🐍

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository!  
Here, I'm practicing basic programming exercises, logic challenges and progressively working towards creating my own projects — including a game inspired by **Doom**.

## 📌 What you'll find here:
- 📖 Basic exercises (math operations, lists, conditionals, loops)
- 🎲 Logic challenges
- 🎮 Simple games (coming soon)
- 🚀 Personal projects as I advance

## 🎯 Goal:
To improve my Python skills from scratch and eventually build a game project with graphics and gameplay mechanics.
